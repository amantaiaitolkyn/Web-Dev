         <h2 class="e1">Recreation options</h2>
         <ol>
             <li class="l1"><strong>Tour</strong></li>
             <p class="e2">The cost of a trip as part of a package tour <em class="x1">will cost from 400 to 1000 euros per person per week</em>. Plus a package tour – everything was planned for you, minus a bus, at least 50 neighbors and overnight stays far from the city center, so <strong class="s1">you probably won't be able to really see all the sights.</strong></p>
             <li class="l1">By yourself</li>
             <p>A little more expensive, but it's much more interesting to plan a trip yourself. There are more than <strong class="s1">60 UNESCO heritage sites</strong> in the country, <em class="x1">dozens</em> of ski resorts, <em class="x1">hundreds</em> of beautiful beaches and <em class="x1">thermal</em> springs, an endless number of argo farms for rural recreation.
             </p>
         </ol>
         <h2 class="e1">Weather</h2>
        <p>Italy stretches from north to south for <strong class="s1">600 km</strong>, the temperature is different, but most likely you will have to undress rather than warm up. In Rome, even in winter, there are a lot of sunny days, the temperature during the day is from <em class="x1">+10 to +15 degrees, at night about +5</em>. Snow falls once a decade for a couple of hours and is a miracle for the locals. </p>

        <p>It is most convenient to travel between major cities by high–speed trains ItaloTreno and Trenitalia - this is the fastest and most comfortable way to get to Rome, Verona, Florence, Venice, Naples, Turin, Bologna, Milan.</p>
